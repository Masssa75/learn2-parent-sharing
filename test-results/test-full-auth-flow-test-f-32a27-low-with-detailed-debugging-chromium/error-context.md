- heading "Great Phonics Lesson for My 4 Year Old" [level=2]
- paragraph: I used this video to teach my4 year old phonics. I looked for a lot of stuff, but this made the most sense. I got the printable work book as well. My daughter really enjoyed going through this. We didn't push reading on our kids. My daugther just kept asking for it. My daughter didn't read exceptionally early since we didn't push it on her. But when she started proper reading lessons in first great, she picked it up extremely quickly. Learned proper reading and writing in just the first month of school and now she's reading everything nonstop. We need to tell her to stop reading and join the dinner table! I don't know how much of it was due to this lesson, but it surely didn't hurt.

- heading "Amazing \"holding\" Technique for New Born Babies" [level=2]
- paragraph: "This tip is for babies from like two weeks up to six months old, and it was a huge game changer for me. The problem: babies cry when their stomach is empty because stomach acid hurts them. But when they cry too early, mom's boob isn't ready yet - not enough milk. Then baby doesn't get enough, hurts the mom, everyone's miserable. Here's what really helps: hold the baby face down on your arm, like a leopard on a tree branch, at a 45 degree angle. Your arm is the branch, baby draped over it with limbs hanging down, face in your palm. This keeps the stomach opening high so acid can't come out. The baby almost instantly stops crying. You can drag out another 30 minutes before they really need to eat, giving the boob time to fill up. Sometimes baby just sucks on your finger and falls asleep because it's so comfortable. Just make sure your hands are clean. But yeah, absolute game changer."

- heading "Kids Learn Touch Typing in Hours with This Amazing App" [level=2]
- paragraph: I've tried a ton of different typing apps when I wanted to improve my own writing speed years ago. Typingclub was by far the best. When my daughter now started typing she first used a really silly kids focused typing app that didn't get her anywhere. With this app she started properly "eyes off the keyboard" typing just a few hours after getting started. And she loves practicing with it!

- heading "BEST TV Series for Young Kids" [level=2]
- paragraph: We don't have a TV at home and only have 30 min of "watching time" per week. I think that watching anything just affects kids badly. On top of that, most kids shows are super high frequency. They very quickly copy that behaviour. on top of that, most kids shows are just for entertainment, not really educational. I think bluey is a very cute show. It's not as high frequency as other shows and every episode has a very beautiful lesson. I still prefer my kids to not watch anything. But if it must be, then bluey is a pretty good choice.
